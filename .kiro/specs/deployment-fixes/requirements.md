# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Student Life Management System is currently facing deployment issues on the Render platform. The primary issue is a missing dependency ('multer') which is required for file uploads in the assignment controller. Additionally, there may be other deployment-related improvements needed to ensure smooth operation in production environments.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to fix the missing dependencies in the project, so that the application can be deployed successfully without errors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application is deployed THEN all required dependencies SHALL be properly installed
2. WHEN the application starts up THEN there SHALL be no "module not found" errors
3. WHEN the backend server starts THEN all controllers and routes SHALL load successfully
4. WHEN a dependency is used in the code THEN it SHALL be properly listed in the package.json file

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to improve the build and deployment process, so that deployments are more reliable and consistent.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the build script runs THEN it SHALL install all dependencies for both frontend and backend
2. WHEN the application is deployed THEN environment variables SHALL be properly configured
3. WHEN deploying to Render THEN the build and start commands SHALL be correctly specified
4. WHEN the application is deployed THEN file upload directories SHALL be properly created and accessible

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to implement proper error handling and logging, so that deployment issues can be quickly identified and resolved.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an error occurs during startup THEN the application SHALL log detailed error information
2. WHEN a dependency is missing THEN the application SHALL provide a clear error message with instructions
3. WHEN file operations fail THEN the application SHALL handle the errors gracefully
4. WHEN the application starts successfully THEN it SHALL log confirmation of successful initialization

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to ensure the application is secure and follows best practices, so that it is production-ready.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN storing sensitive information THEN the application SHALL use environment variables
2. WHEN handling file uploads THEN the application SHALL validate file types and sizes
3. WHEN deploying to production THEN development dependencies SHALL be separated from production dependencies
4. WHEN running in production mode THEN appropriate security headers SHALL be set
