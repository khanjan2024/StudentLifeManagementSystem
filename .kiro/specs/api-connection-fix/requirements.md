# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for fixing the API connection issues in the Student Life Management System. Currently, the frontend application is encountering connection errors when attempting to connect to the backend API, specifically showing "ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED" errors when trying to access endpoints like "/AdminLogin". This prevents users from logging in and using the system effectively.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to be able to connect to the backend API from the frontend application, so that I can log in and use the system without connection errors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the frontend application makes API calls THEN the system SHALL successfully connect to the correct backend API endpoint
2. WHEN the backend server is running locally THEN the frontend SHALL connect to the local backend server
3. WHEN the application is deployed THEN the frontend SHALL connect to the deployed backend server
4. WHEN connection to the API fails THEN the system SHALL display a user-friendly error message

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want consistent API base URL configuration across all environments, so that the application works reliably in both development and production.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application runs in development mode THEN the system SHALL use the correct local API base URL
2. WHEN the application runs in production mode THEN the system SHALL use the correct production API base URL
3. WHEN environment variables are available THEN the system SHALL use them for API base URL configuration
4. WHEN environment variables are not available THEN the system SHALL fall back to appropriate default URLs

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want clear error handling for API connection issues, so that users receive helpful feedback when connection problems occur.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an API connection fails THEN the system SHALL display a user-friendly error message
2. WHEN a connection timeout occurs THEN the system SHALL retry the connection a reasonable number of times
3. WHEN all connection attempts fail THEN the system SHALL provide guidance on how to resolve the issue
4. WHEN connection issues occur THEN the system SHALL log detailed error information for debugging

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want a reliable backend server startup process, so that the API is always available when needed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the backend server starts THEN the system SHALL log confirmation of successful initialization
2. WHEN required environment variables are missing THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages
3. WHEN the server fails to start THEN the system SHALL log detailed error information
4. WHEN database connection fails THEN the system SHALL handle the error gracefully and provide clear feedback
